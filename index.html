  <h1>Electronic Measuring Instruments</h1>
  <body>
    <p>The instruments used to measure any quantity are known as <strong>measuring instruments.</strong>
    <br />If the instrument can measure the basic electrical quantities, such as voltage and current
    <br />are known as <strong>basic measuring instruments.</strong><br />Electrical Units of Measurement are used to express standard electrical units alnog<br />
    with their prefixes when the units are too small or too large to express as a base unit.<br />The standard units of
    <strong>electrical measurement</strong> used for the expression of <strong>Voltage, Current and Resistance</strong><br />
    Volt[V], Ampere[A] and Ohm respectively.<br />These electrical units of measurement are based on the International (metric) System,<br />
    also known as the SI System with other commonly used electrical units being derived from SI based units.
